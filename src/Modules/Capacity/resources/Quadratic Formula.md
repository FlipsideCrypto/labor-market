The quadratic formula helps us solve any quadratic equation. First, we bring the equation to the form $ax^2+bx+c=0$, where a, b, and c are coefficients. 

Given a general quadratic equation of the form:

$$
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
$$

We can plug these coefficients in the formula:

$$
\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$
Where the $\pm$ symbol indicates that the quadratic equation has two solutions. Written separtely, they become:

$$
x_1=\frac{-b+\sqrt{b^2-4 a c}}{2 a} \text { or } x_2=\frac{-b-\sqrt{b^2-4 a c}}{2 a}
$$

Each of these two solutions is also called a root (or zero) of the quadratic equation. Geometrically, these roots represent the x-values at which any parabola, explicity given as $y=ax^2 + bx + c$, crosses the x-axis.

As well as being a formula that yields the zeroes of any parabola, the quadratic formula can also be used to identify the axis of symmetry of the parabola, and the number of real zeros the quadratic equation contains.

The expression $b^2 - 4ac$ is known as discriminant. If $b^2 - 4ac >= 0$ then the square root of the discriminant will be a real number; otherwise it will be a complex number. If $a != 0$, b, and c are real numbers then

1. If $b^2 - 4ac > 0$ then we have two distinct real roots/solutions to the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
2. If $b^2 - 4ac = 0$ then we have one repeated real solution.
3. If $b^2 - 4ac < 0$ then we have two distinct complex solutions, which are [[Complex Numbers#Complex conjugates|complex conjugates]] of each other.

Completing the square can also be accomplished by a sometimes shorter and simpler sequence:

1. Multiply each side by $4a$
2. Rearrange.
3. Add $b^2$ to both sides to complete the square.
4. The left side is the outcome of the polynomial $(2ax + b)^2$ 
5. Take the square root of both sides.
6. Isolate $x$.

In which case, the quadratic formula can also be derived as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a x^2+b x+c &=0 \\
4 a^2 x^2+4 a b x+4 a c &=0 \\
4 a^2 x^2+4 a b x &=-4 a c \\
4 a^2 x^2+4 a b x+b^2 &=b^2-4 a c \\
(2 a x+b)^2 &=b^2-4 a c \\
2 a x+b &=\pm \sqrt{b^2-4 a c} \\
2 a x &=-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4 a c} \\
x &=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4 a c}}{2 a} .
\end{aligned}
$$

This derivation of the quadratic formula is ancient and was known in India at least as far back as 1025. Compared with the derivation in standard usage, this alternate derivation avoids fractions and squared fractions until the last step and hence does not require a rearrangement after step 3 to obtain a common denominator in the right side.

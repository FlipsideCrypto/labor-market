 *         determine if someone has access to perform an action however there are very 
 *         few ways to acquire the "keys" to the locks. Badger solves this by digitalizing 
 *         centralized organization management while maintaing the full capacity to cover 
 *         the more generalized and decentralized use-cases through time.

     *   needing to spin up their own front-end.

     *   they can deploy a parent contract that extends the `BadgerOrganization` or
     *  `BadgerScout` contracts and then deploy their own version of the `Badger` contract
     *   that points to their own implementation and then deploy through this function.
